# Maven-Movie-Project
SITUATION:
You and your business partner were recently approached by another local business owner who is interested in purchasing Maven Movies. He primarily owns restaurants and bars, so he has lots of questions for you about your business and the rental business in general. His offer seems very generous, so you are going to entertain his questions.

OBJECTIVE:
Leverage your SQL skills to extract and analyze data from various tables in the Maven Movies database to answer your potential Acquirerâ€™s questions. Each question will require you to write a multi-table SQL query, joining at least two tables.

THE LETTERY FROM OWNER
Dear Maven Movies Management,
I am excited about the potential acquisition and learning more about your rental business. Please bear with me as I am new to the industry, but I have a number of questions for you. Assuming you can answer them all, and that there are no major surprises, we should be able to move forward with the purchase.
Best,
Martin Moneybags
